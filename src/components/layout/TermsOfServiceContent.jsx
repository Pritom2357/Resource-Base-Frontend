    <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2. Use License</h3>
    <p>Permission is granted to temporarily access materials on ResourceBase for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p>

      <li>Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by ResourceBase at any time.</p>
    
    <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-6 mb-3">3. User Content</h3>
    <p>Users may post content as long as it is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam."</p>
    <p>ResourceBase reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, but does not regularly review posted content.</p>

    <p>Further, ResourceBase does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.</p>
    
    <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-6 mb-3">5. Limitations</h3>
    <p>In no event shall ResourceBase or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on ResourceBase, even if ResourceBase or a ResourceBase authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.</p>
    
    <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-6 mb-3">6. Governing Law</h3>
